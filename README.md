## Overview
![Screenshot showing Time-Page](https://github.com/Armin2208/Windows-Auto-Night-Mode/blob/master/Readme/screenshot1.png)
Android, GNOME Shell, iOS and MacOS already offer the possibility of changing the system design based on the time of day. So why not Windows too?

Auto Dark Mode helps you to be more productive. When it is light outside, we enable you to have a bright and clearly readable OS. After the sun starts to set, your operating system switches to a matching theme to take care of your eyes. This app saves you from the annoying way to switch the design manually in the Windows settings.

By enabling the automatic theme switcher in the app, a task in the Task Scheduler of Windows is created. This task will launch the app and set your theme. No background task, no interruption of a CMD-window, no footprint and no reliability issues. You can find many settings in the easy-to-understand user interface.

## Download and installing

#### [Click here to download the newest version of Auto Dark Mode!](https://github.com/Armin2208/Windows-Auto-Night-Mode/releases)

#### Installation
Installing is pretty easy as you only need to run the setup file provided as .exe. If you want to deploy Auto Dark Mode on multiple machines, you can use the argument _/verysilent_ to skip the installer window.

#### Annotation
Windows SmartScreen-Filter, your webbrowser or some antivirus software may warn you from downloading or starting this app. This is due to the missing signature license, which unfortunately I cannot afford. But from the numerous github stars you can see that many people use the program without problems.
