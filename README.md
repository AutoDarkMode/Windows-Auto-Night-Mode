## Overview

Tired of looking at dark content while the sun is shining brightly? But at night everything is suddenly too bright? Auto Dark Mode is the solution for you!

Android, iOS and MacOS already offer the possibility of changing the system design based on the time of the day. We're bringing this feature to Windows on a larger scale. 

Auto Dark Mode helps you to be more productive. Because you shouldn't care about changing Windows settings several times a day. As soon as the sun goes down, we'll take care of your eyes.

Because a simple design change would be too boring, Auto Dark Mode is packed with useful functions. For example, we can also change your desktop wallpaper or run custom scripts.
