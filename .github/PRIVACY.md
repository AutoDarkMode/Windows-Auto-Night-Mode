# Auto Dark Mode Privacy Statement
We (the Auto Dark Mode Team) don't collect any data about our users. This app does not use telemetry, all settings are saved offline and
log files are only stored on the personal computer.

Some features of this app use third party services which may collect data:
By using Auto Dark Mode, you thus also agree to these services' privacy policies.

### Device Location
On our end, the collected data is only processed locally for sunrise/sunset calculation and does not leave the machine, nor is it used for analytics.

If you choose to automatically determine your sun times via "From sunset to sunrise", Microsoft Windows may collect some location data. For example, we use the Microsoft Bing API "MapLocationFinder" to get your current city name and the Windows location service to retrieve geographic coordinates.

Because of this, the Microsoft data privacy policy applies:

- [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement)
- [Windows Location Service Privacy Notice](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-location-service-and-privacy-3a8eee0a-5b0b-dc07-eede-2a5ca1c49088)

### App Updater using the GitHub Server
On our end, we don't collect any data related to updates from our users. Everything is processed on the machine and will never be transmitted via the internet.

To check for app updates, we connect to the GitHub server hosting our repository. The app retrieves metadata files that contain information about the newest version. Additionally, the updater can then download new versions from the GitHub server.

GitHub may collect some personal data while communicating with its servers. Because of this, the GitHub data privacy policy applies:

* File System (for choosing a Windows Theme that is saved locally)

### Changes to our Privacy Statement
